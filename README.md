_Abstract_:

The goal of any Digital Transformation is a reorientation of companies to meet the challenges and demands of the current era of digitization. These large-scale changes can lead to other challenges and problems that can be countered by using specific techniques. Successful digital transformation is necessary in order to remain permanently competitive.

Using a two-part systematic literature review, the present work investigates possible problem areas of the digital transformation of large companies. Furthermore, agile methods are being developed that have increasingly found their way into the transformation process. In a subsequent evaluation, both test results are linked by further investigating in which problem areas the selected agile methods can be used.

In the first review, 23 case studies were systematically examined, summarized and clustered, which led to 21 problem areas of the digital transformation. In the second review, 32 case studies and specialist literature on the topic were examined, which allowed 18 agile methods to be extracted. These were then evaluated using a clear scheme.

As a result, a set of guidelines for the successful application of agile methods in the digital transformation are set up. These can be used as a starting point for the planning of change processes in the context of digital transformation.
